This is a typical cloudflare project. Just make changes to index.js and wrangler.toml, and you're good to go!

[`index.js`](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template/blob/master/index.js) is the content of the Workers script.

#### index.js
Change the variables `MY_DOMAIN`, `SLUG_TO_PAGE`, `PAGE_TITLES`, `PAGE_DESCRIPTIONS`, `DEFAULT_TITLE`, `DEFAULT_DESC`, AND `CUSTOM_SCRIPT` in `index.js` to your own domains and pages
