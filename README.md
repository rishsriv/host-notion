# ðŸ‘· Host Notion on Cloudflare Workers!

This is a typical cloudflare project. Just make changes to index.js and wrangler.toml, and you're good to go!

[`index.js`](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template/blob/master/index.js) is the content of the Workers script.

#### Wrangler

To generate using [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler)

```

```

Further documentation for Wrangler can be found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler).
